I found the App statement "Device is unhealthy" to be determined by blocked DNS requests. Therefore I created this whitelist.

Add the RAW .txt file URL per http://AdGuard:3000/#dns_allowlists

Give device_other ctag to work devices or other desired clients

Check functionality with http://AdGuard:3000/#logs
